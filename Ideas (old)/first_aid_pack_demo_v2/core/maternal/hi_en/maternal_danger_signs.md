# Maternal Danger Signs
Pregnancy complications can develop suddenly and be life-threatening.  
Red flags include severe bleeding, convulsions, and unconsciousness.  
Other danger signs: severe headache, blurred vision, swelling of face/hands.  
Prolonged labor beyond 12 hours in first pregnancy is a risk.  
Foul-smelling discharge or high fever may indicate infection.  
Encourage women to seek skilled birth attendance whenever possible.  
Keep transport arrangements ready for emergencies.  
Do not delay referral when red flag signs are present.  
Support family decision-making in favor of rapid referral.  
Community awareness saves maternal lives.
