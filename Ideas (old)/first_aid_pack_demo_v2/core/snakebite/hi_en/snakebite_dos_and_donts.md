# Snakebite
Keep the patient calm and lying still to slow the spread of venom.  
Remove rings, bangles, or tight clothing from the bitten limb.  
Immobilize the limb with a splint and keep it at heart level.  
Do not cut, suck, burn, or apply ice to the bite.  
Do not apply tight tourniquets; they can cause more harm.  
Transport the patient quickly and safely to the nearest hospital with antivenom.  
Try to note the snakeâ€™s appearance but do not waste time capturing it.  
Reassure the patient and discourage walking or running.  
Record the time of the bite and any first aid given.  
Look for warning signs such as drooping eyelids, difficulty breathing, or uncontrolled bleeding.
