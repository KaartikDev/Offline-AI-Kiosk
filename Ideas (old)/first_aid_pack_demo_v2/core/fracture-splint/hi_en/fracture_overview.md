# Fracture & Splinting
Fractures may present with pain, swelling, deformity, and inability to use the limb.  
Immobilize the joint above and below the suspected fracture.  
Use local materials such as bamboo sticks, boards, or rolled newspapers as splints.  
Pad the splints with cloth before tying them in place.  
Avoid moving the broken bone excessively while applying the splint.  
Check circulation in fingers or toes after splinting to ensure it is not too tight.  
Do not try to push protruding bone ends back inside.  
Transport the patient carefully, avoiding unnecessary movement.  
Seek medical help as soon as possible for X-ray and definitive care.  
Watch for signs of shock and bleeding with open fractures.
