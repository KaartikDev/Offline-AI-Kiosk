# Diarrhea, ORS & Zinc
Diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration, especially in children.  
Signs of dehydration include sunken eyes, dry mouth, and lethargy.  
Prepare homemade ORS: 6 level teaspoons of sugar + 1/2 teaspoon salt in 1 liter of clean water.  
Give frequent small sips of ORS after each loose stool.  
Continue breastfeeding and normal feeding during diarrhea.  
Provide zinc supplementation (10–20 mg daily for 10–14 days) to children under five.  
Do not give antibiotics unless prescribed by a health worker.  
Avoid fizzy drinks, sweetened sodas, or very salty broths.  
Seek urgent care if there is blood in stool or the child cannot drink.  
Promote handwashing and safe water use to prevent diarrhea spread.
