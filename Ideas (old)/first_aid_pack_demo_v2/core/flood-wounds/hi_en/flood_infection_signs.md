# Flood-Related Wounds & Infection
Flood water often carries dirt, sewage, and harmful bacteria.  
Clean all cuts and wounds immediately with clean running water and soap.  
Apply antiseptic if available and cover with a clean dressing.  
Change dressings daily or if they become wet or dirty.  
Watch for signs of infection: redness, swelling, pus, fever.  
Ensure tetanus vaccination is up to date after flood injuries.  
Avoid walking barefoot in flood waters to reduce risk of infection.  
Do not apply mud, herbs, or dirty cloths to wounds.  
Seek medical care if fever, spreading redness, or severe pain develops.  
Support community cleanup of flood debris to reduce injury risk.
