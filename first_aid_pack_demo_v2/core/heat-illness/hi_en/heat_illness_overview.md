# Heat Illness (Exhaustion/Heatstroke)
Heat exhaustion presents with heavy sweating, weakness, and nausea.  
Move the patient to a shaded or cool place immediately.  
Give small sips of cool, clean water with a pinch of salt and sugar.  
Remove excess clothing and loosen tight garments.  
Apply wet cloths to armpits, neck, and groin, and fan the person.  
Heatstroke is a medical emergency with confusion, seizures, or loss of consciousness.  
Do not give fluids if the person is unconscious; place them in recovery position.  
Call for urgent medical help if symptoms do not improve quickly.  
Cool the patient aggressively until medical care is available.  
Prevent heat illness by drinking water regularly and avoiding activity during midday heat.
