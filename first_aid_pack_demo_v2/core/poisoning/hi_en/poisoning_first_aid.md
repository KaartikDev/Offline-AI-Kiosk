# Common Poisoning (Pesticides)
Accidental poisoning is common in rural areas due to unsafe pesticide storage.  
Keep all chemicals in labeled, closed containers away from children.  
If ingestion occurs, do not induce vomiting.  
Remove contaminated clothing and wash skin with soap and water.  
If chemicals contact eyes, rinse with plenty of clean water.  
Take the container or label to the health facility if possible.  
Supportive care and antidotes may be available in hospitals.  
Watch for warning signs: excessive drooling, difficulty breathing, convulsions.  
Do not give milk or home remedies without medical advice.  
Promote safe storage and handling of chemicals in the community.
