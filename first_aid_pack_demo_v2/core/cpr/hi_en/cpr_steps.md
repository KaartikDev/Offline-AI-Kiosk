# Hands-Only CPR
Cardiac arrest means the heart has stopped pumping effectively.  
Check for responsiveness and breathing; call for help immediately.  
Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest, other hand on top.  
Push hard and fast at 100â€“120 compressions per minute.  
Allow full chest recoil after each push.  
Do not stop until help arrives or the person moves.  
Hands-only CPR is effective and simple for untrained bystanders.  
If trained, provide rescue breaths in a 30:2 ratio with compressions.  
Ensure the scene is safe before starting CPR.  
Encourage communities to practice CPR skills regularly.
