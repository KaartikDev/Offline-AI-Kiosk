# Choking (Adult/Child/Infant)
Choking occurs when an object blocks the airway.  
Adults and children who cannot cough or speak need immediate help.  
Perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) for adults and older children.  
For infants under 1 year, give 5 back blows followed by 5 chest thrusts.  
Do not attempt blind finger sweeps in the mouth.  
If the person becomes unresponsive, start CPR immediately.  
Always call for emergency help if choking does not resolve.  
Encourage the person to keep coughing if they can still breathe or speak.  
After successful relief, have the person checked by a health worker.  
Teach caregivers and community members basic choking first aid.
