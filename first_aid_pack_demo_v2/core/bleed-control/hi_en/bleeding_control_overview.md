# Severe Bleeding Control
Severe bleeding can quickly become life-threatening if not controlled.  
Apply firm direct pressure with a clean cloth or sterile gauze.  
If bleeding soaks through, add more cloths without removing the first.  
Elevate the injured limb if possible while maintaining pressure.  
Use a tourniquet if direct pressure fails and bleeding is from an arm or leg.  
Note the time a tourniquet is applied and do not remove it until in a hospital.  
Check the personâ€™s airway, breathing, and circulation while giving first aid.  
Reassure the patient and keep them warm to prevent shock.  
Transport urgently to the nearest medical facility if bleeding does not stop.  
Do not apply mud, ash, or unclean materials to the wound.
