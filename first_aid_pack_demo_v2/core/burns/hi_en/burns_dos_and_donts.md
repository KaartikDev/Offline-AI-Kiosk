# Burns (Flame/Scald/Electrical)
Cool the burn immediately with clean running water for at least 20 minutes.  
Remove jewelry or tight clothing near the burned area before swelling begins.  
Do not apply butter, oil, toothpaste, or traditional remedies.  
Cover the burn with a clean, non-stick cloth or sterile dressing.  
Do not break blisters; they protect the underlying skin.  
Check for difficulty breathing in burns of the face, neck, or chest.  
Electrical burns may have deep tissue damage even if skin looks normal.  
Hydrate the patient and keep them warm while awaiting medical help.  
Severe burns covering more than 10% of the body need urgent hospital referral.  
Record what caused the burn (fire, scald, electricity) for the health provider.
