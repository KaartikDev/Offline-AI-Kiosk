# Flooding & Storm Safety (Pinellas County, FL)

Flooding and storm surge are the **greatest threats** to life and property during hurricanes in Pinellas County.  
Follow these guidelines to stay safe before, during, and after flood conditions.

## 1. General Flood Safety
- Never walk, swim, or drive through floodwaters — **Turn Around, Don’t Drown**.  
- Six inches of fast-moving water can knock down an adult; 12–18 inches can sweep away a vehicle.  
- Avoid bridges and overpasses in storm surge zones; water may be deeper or flowing faster than it looks.  
- Stay away from downed power lines and electrical wires in flooded areas.

## 2. Preparing Before Flooding
- Know your **Evacuation Zone** and have a safe route planned: [Know Your Zone Tool](https://kyz.pinellas.gov).  
- Store important documents (ID, insurance, bank info) in waterproof bags.  
- Elevate appliances and electrical systems if you live in a flood-prone area.  
- Install check valves in plumbing to prevent floodwater backup.  
- Keep sandbags or water barriers ready to protect entry points.

## 3. During Flooding
- Evacuate immediately if ordered.  
- Move to higher ground or the highest level inside your home — **do not shelter in an attic without an exit**.  
- Keep a NOAA weather radio and listen for flood warnings or flash flood alerts.  
- Shut off utilities (gas, water, electricity) if instructed by authorities.

## 4. After Flooding
- Return home only after officials give the all-clear.  
- Avoid standing water — it may be contaminated with sewage, oil, or chemicals.  
- Clean and disinfect everything that got wet; wear protective gear (gloves, boots, masks).  
- Document property damage with photos before cleanup for insurance claims.  
- Watch for mold growth; ventilate and dry your home quickly.

## 5. Storm Surge Safety
- Storm surge is **the leading cause of hurricane deaths** in Pinellas County.  
- Surge risk varies by **evacuation zone (A–E)** — zones closer to the coast are at highest risk.  
- Follow evacuation orders **early**; roads may close before surge arrives.  
- Never stay in mobile homes or RVs in surge zones.  
- If caught by rising water, move to the roof if necessary and signal for help with a cloth, flashlight, or whistle.
