# Communication During a Hurricane (Pinellas County, FL)

Staying informed and connected is critical during a hurricane. Power outages, downed cell towers, and flooding can make communication difficult, so plan ahead.

## 1. Stay Informed
- **NOAA Weather Radio** — battery-powered or hand-crank radios provide continuous updates.  
- **Local News & Radio** — WFLA (970 AM), WUSF (89.7 FM), Bay News 9, and other local outlets provide emergency info.  
- **Pinellas County Alerts**:  
  - [Alert Pinellas](https://pinellas.gov/alert-pinellas/) — free text, email, or phone alerts.  
  - [Pinellas County Emergency Info](https://pinellas.gov/emergency-information/) — official updates.

## 2. Conserve Phone Battery

- Turn off background apps and lower screen brightness.  
- Use portable chargers or solar chargers if available.

## 5. Backup Options
- Use **two-way radios or walkie-talkies** if cell networks are down.
